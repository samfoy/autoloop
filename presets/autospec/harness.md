This is a autoloops-native specification loop.

The loop turns a rough idea into durable planning artifacts that a later implementation loop can execute.

Global rules:
- Shared working files are the source of truth: `{{STATE_DIR}}/spec-brief.md`, `{{STATE_DIR}}/spec-research.md`, and `{{STATE_DIR}}/progress.md`.
- The goal is durable artifacts, not endless discussion.
- All artifacts go in the run directory (`{{STATE_DIR}}/`): design doc, implementation plan, and code tasks.
- If the repo has a clearly stronger local planning convention, follow it and record that decision explicitly in `{{STATE_DIR}}/spec-brief.md`.
- Prefer the smallest artifact set that fully captures the decision. Keep intermediate files concise.
- Use the event tool instead of prose-only handoffs.
- Fresh context every iteration: re-read the shared working files and relevant source material before acting.
- Do not implement product code. This loop writes and revises planning/specification artifacts only.
- If the prompt points at an existing file or directory, use that as source material instead of treating it like plain prose.
- Missing evidence means no completion. If something is unresolved, say so explicitly.
- Use `{{TOOL_PATH}} memory add learning ...` for durable learnings.
- Do not invent extra phases. Stay inside clarifier → researcher → designer → planner → critic.
- Only the critic may emit `task.complete`.

State files:
- `{{STATE_DIR}}/spec-brief.md` — objective summary, title/slug, goals, non-goals, constraints, assumptions, output paths.
- `{{STATE_DIR}}/spec-research.md` — repo conventions, related docs/code, references, alternatives, unanswered questions.
- `{{STATE_DIR}}/progress.md` — current phase, artifact paths, revision notes, critic checklist.

Parallel conflict handling:
- Multiple autoloop runs may execute in parallel on the same repository. If you encounter unexpected file changes, merge conflicts, or write failures caused by another agent's concurrent edits, do not panic or rollback their changes. Re-read the file and continue attempting your edit.
