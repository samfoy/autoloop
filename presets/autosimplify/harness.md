This is a autoloops-native autosimplify loop inspired by Claude Code's `/simplify` workflow.

Global rules:
- Shared working files are the source of truth: `{{STATE_DIR}}/simplify-context.md`, `{{STATE_DIR}}/simplify-plan.md`, and `{{STATE_DIR}}/progress.md`.
- Scope defaults to the current diff. If there is no diff, fall back to recently modified files. If the user explicitly names files or directories, respect that scope.
- Keep only one simplification batch active at a time.
- Use the event tool instead of prose-only handoffs.
- Fresh context every iteration: re-read the shared working files and the relevant source before acting.
- Preserve behavior exactly. This loop simplifies code; it does not add features, silently broaden scope, or redesign APIs unless the user explicitly asked for that.
- Prefer deleting code, reusing existing helpers, reducing nesting, and making control flow plainer over introducing new abstractions.
- Review and simplification should focus on three dimensions: reuse, clarity, and efficiency. Efficiency here means obvious waste, not speculative micro-optimization.
- The simplifier must record exact files changed and exact verification command(s) with outputs in `{{STATE_DIR}}/progress.md` before claiming success.
- If a simplification batch changes code, commit that batch before handing off. Each accepted simplification batch should land as its own commit instead of accumulating a large dirty tree.
- The verifier must independently inspect the actual diff and surrounding code. Another role's summary is not proof.
- Missing evidence means rejection, retry, or no-op justification — never silent acceptance.
- `no-op` is valid only when the reviewer and verifier both conclude the scoped code is already appropriately simple.
- Use `{{TOOL_PATH}} memory add learning ...` for durable learnings.
- Do not invent extra phases. Stay inside scoper → reviewer → simplifier → verifier.
- Only the scoper may emit `task.complete`.
- Once `{{STATE_DIR}}/progress.md` records a verified terminal stop condition (no remaining narrow batch in the scoped diff), later reactivations are idempotent: leave the shared files alone unless the scoped diff meaningfully changed.

State files:
- `{{STATE_DIR}}/simplify-context.md` — current objective, scope detection method, batched files, and out-of-scope guardrails.
- `{{STATE_DIR}}/simplify-plan.md` — current batch findings, what to keep, what to simplify, and relevant validation commands.
- `{{STATE_DIR}}/progress.md` — active batch, edits made, verification evidence, rejected attempts, and next action.

Parallel conflict handling:
- Multiple autoloop runs may execute in parallel on the same repository. If you encounter unexpected file changes, merge conflicts, or write failures caused by another agent's concurrent edits, do not panic or rollback their changes. Re-read the file and continue attempting your edit.
