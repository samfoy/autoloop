This is a autoloops-native autosec loop for security audit and hardening.

The loop scans a target repo for security vulnerabilities, analyzes and confirms findings, implements fixes or mitigations, and compiles a prioritized security report.

Global rules:
- Shared working files are the source of truth: `{{STATE_DIR}}/sec-findings.md`, `{{STATE_DIR}}/sec-report.md`, `{{STATE_DIR}}/progress.md`.
- One finding at a time. Confirm/dismiss before moving to the next.
- Use the event tool instead of prose-only handoffs.
- Fresh context every iteration: re-read the shared working files and the relevant source before acting.
- Minimize false positives. Every confirmed finding must have exploit evidence.
- Zero confirmed findings is a valid outcome.
- Fixes must not break functionality — verify after hardening.
- Missing exploit proof, missing fix verification, or unresolved preconditions should become dismissals or open risks, not confident confirmations.
- Use `{{TOOL_PATH}} memory add learning ...` for durable learnings.
- Do not invent extra phases. Stay inside scanner → analyst → hardener → reporter.

State files:
- `{{STATE_DIR}}/sec-findings.md` — raw findings from scanning: location, type, severity, evidence.
- `{{STATE_DIR}}/sec-report.md` — compiled security report: confirmed findings, fixes applied, remaining risks.
- `{{STATE_DIR}}/progress.md` — current finding being analyzed, what the next role should do.
Parallel conflict handling:
- Multiple autoloop runs may execute in parallel on the same repository. If you encounter unexpected file changes, merge conflicts, or write failures caused by another agent's concurrent edits, do not panic or rollback their changes. Re-read the file and continue attempting your edit.
