This is an autoloops-native systematic debugging loop.

The loop enforces a four-phase debugging process: Bug Clarification → Root Cause Investigation → Hypothesis Testing → Implementation. NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST.

Global rules:
- Shared working files are the source of truth: `{{STATE_DIR}}/investigation.md`, `{{STATE_DIR}}/hypothesis.md`, `{{STATE_DIR}}/fix-log.md`, and `{{STATE_DIR}}/progress.md`.
- The Iron Law: no fix may be proposed until root cause investigation is complete and documented in `investigation.md`.
- The Reframing Rule: the objective may be vague, misleading, or phrased as a question. The investigator MUST reframe it into a concrete bug statement ("When [action], [actual] instead of [expected]") before investigating. Never take a "why" question at face value — the user is reporting a bug, not asking for an architecture explanation.
- The Reproduction Rule: the investigator MUST attempt to reproduce the bug through the actual user flow before reading code. Code reading without reproduction leads to answering the wrong question.
- The No-WAD Rule: "Working as designed" is almost never the correct conclusion. If any role concludes this, the verifier MUST reject and send back to the investigator with instructions to reframe and reproduce.
- Use the event tool instead of prose-only handoffs.
- Fresh context every iteration: re-read the shared working files and relevant source code before acting.
- Missing evidence means no success. No role may treat another role's assertion as proof.
- Only the verifier may emit `task.complete`.
- If 3+ fix attempts fail, the fixer MUST emit `fix.escalate` instead of attempting another fix. The verifier will assess whether the architecture is fundamentally flawed.

Red flags that MUST trigger return to Phase 1 (investigator):
- "Quick fix for now, investigate later"
- "Just try changing X and see if it works"
- Proposing solutions before tracing data flow
- 3+ failed fix attempts without questioning architecture
- Fixing at the symptom point instead of the root cause
- Concluding "working as designed" without reproducing the user flow
- Answering a "why" question literally instead of finding the bug
- Reading code before attempting reproduction
- Investigation has no concrete bug statement (expected vs actual)

State files:
- `{{STATE_DIR}}/investigation.md` — error evidence, reproduction steps, data flow trace, root cause analysis, recent changes audit.
- `{{STATE_DIR}}/hypothesis.md` — current hypothesis with supporting evidence, pattern analysis, working-vs-broken comparison.
- `{{STATE_DIR}}/fix-log.md` — ordered log of all fix attempts with results. Tracks attempt count for the escalation rule.
- `{{STATE_DIR}}/progress.md` — current phase, decisions, evidence gathered, notes for the next role.

Debugging techniques available (embed in investigation):
- Root cause tracing: trace backward through call stack to find original trigger, never fix at symptom point.
- Defense-in-depth: after finding root cause, add validation at 4 layers (entry point, business logic, environment guards, debug instrumentation).
- Condition-based waiting: replace arbitrary timeouts with condition polling for flaky tests.
- Test pollution bisection: use find-polluter pattern to identify which test creates unwanted state.

Parallel conflict handling:
- Multiple autoloop runs may execute in parallel on the same repository. If you encounter unexpected file changes, merge conflicts, or write failures caused by another agent's concurrent edits, do not panic or rollback their changes. Re-read the file and continue attempting your edit.
