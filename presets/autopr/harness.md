<!-- category: planning -->
This preset turns the current branch into a reviewable pull request.

Global rules:
- Shared working files are the source of truth: `{{STATE_DIR}}/pr-request.md`, `{{STATE_DIR}}/pr-context.md`, `{{STATE_DIR}}/pr-draft.md`, `{{STATE_DIR}}/pr-result.md`, and `{{STATE_DIR}}/progress.md`.
- The job is to publish an accurate PR, not to implement missing code or babysit CI forever.
- Fresh context every iteration: re-read the shared working files, git state, and relevant source before acting.
- Use the event tool instead of prose-only handoffs.
- Missing evidence means no publish. If checks were not run, say so explicitly in the PR draft.
- Do not invent verification, issue links, labels, reviewers, or mergeability state.
- Prefer exact git / gh CLI evidence over summaries from earlier iterations.
- **Remote-first base comparison (mandatory)**: All base-branch comparisons — merge-base, commit list, file diff — must use the remote tracking ref (`origin/<base>`), not the local ref. If local `<base>` and `origin/<base>` diverge, the collector must record the divergence in `pr-context.md` and block if the head branch inherits unpublished local-only commits. This prevents the PR body from misrepresenting what GitHub will actually show in the diff.
- If `{{STATE_DIR}}/pr-request.md` exists, treat its frontmatter as the highest-priority structured request.
- The freeform objective prompt is still valid input, but structured request fields override it.
- Derive defaults when safe: head branch from git, base branch from repo default or `main`, mode defaults to `publish`, draft defaults to `false`.
- Do not publish from a dirty, ambiguous, or detached repo state without calling that out and blocking.
- If a PR already exists for the head branch, update it instead of creating a duplicate unless the request explicitly says otherwise.
- `publish-and-arm` means enable platform auto-merge if supported; do not keep polling.
- `publish-and-merge-if-green` means merge immediately only if checks are already green and mergeability is confirmed right now; otherwise arm auto-merge if available, or block with evidence.
- Stay inside collector -> drafter -> validator -> publisher. Do not merge responsibilities.
- Only the publisher may emit `task.complete`.

Role boundaries (strict):
- The collector normalizes the request and repo state into `{{STATE_DIR}}/pr-context.md`; it does not draft or publish.
- The drafter writes `{{STATE_DIR}}/pr-draft.md`; it does not validate or publish.
- The validator checks the draft against the actual repo state and request; it does not publish.
- The publisher performs the side effect (`gh pr create`, `gh pr edit`, `gh pr merge --auto`, etc.) and records the result.

Parallel conflict handling:
- Multiple autoloop runs may execute in parallel on the same repository. If you encounter unexpected file changes, merge conflicts, or write failures caused by another agent's concurrent edits, do not panic or rollback their changes. Re-read the file and continue attempting your edit.
