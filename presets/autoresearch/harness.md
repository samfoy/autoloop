This is a autoloops-native autoresearch loop inspired by Ralph's autoresearch preset.

The loop runs autonomous experiments: strategize, implement, measure, evaluate.

Global rules:
- Shared working files are the source of truth: `{{STATE_DIR}}/autoresearch.md`, `{{STATE_DIR}}/experiments.jsonl`, and `{{STATE_DIR}}/progress.md`.
- One experiment at a time. Do not start a new experiment before the current one is evaluated.
- Use the event tool instead of prose-only handoffs.
- Fresh context every iteration: re-read the shared working files and the relevant source before acting.
- Prefer small, reversible changes that can be cleanly reverted if the experiment fails.
- Missing baseline, missing raw measurement, missing correctness evidence, or ambiguous metrics should block or discard the experiment, not quietly pass.
- The evaluator makes keep/discard decisions. Other roles do not commit or revert.
- False keeps are worse than false discards.
- Qualitative wins only count when the rubric was written down before the experiment.
- Use `{{TOOL_PATH}} memory add learning ...` for durable learnings.
- Do not invent extra phases. Stay inside strategist -> implementer -> benchmarker -> evaluator.

State files:
- `{{STATE_DIR}}/autoresearch.md` — running session document: goal, constraints, experiment history summary, current hypothesis.
- `{{STATE_DIR}}/experiments.jsonl` — append-only log. Each line: `{"id":N, "hypothesis":"...", "change":"...", "metric_before":..., "metric_after":..., "verdict":"keep|discard", "reason":"..."}`.
- `{{STATE_DIR}}/progress.md` — current experiment status, what the next role should do.

LLM-as-judge:
- The evaluator can invoke `../../scripts/llm-judge.sh` to get a semantic pass/fail verdict.
- Usage: `echo "<content>" | ../../scripts/llm-judge.sh "<criteria>"`
- The judge returns JSON with `{"pass": true|false, "reason": "..."}` and exits 0 (pass) or 1 (fail).
- Use the judge when hard metrics alone are insufficient (e.g., code quality, semantic correctness).
- The judge does not override weak or missing hard evidence.
Parallel conflict handling:
- Multiple autoloop runs may execute in parallel on the same repository. If you encounter unexpected file changes, merge conflicts, or write failures caused by another agent's concurrent edits, do not panic or rollback their changes. Re-read the file and continue attempting your edit.
